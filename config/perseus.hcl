  # This is a random splay to wait before killing the command. The default
  # value is 0 (no wait), but large clusters should consider setting a splay
  # value to prevent all child processes from reloading at the same time when
  # data changes occur. When this value is set to non-zero, Consul Template
  # will wait a random period of time up to the splay value before reloading
  # or killing the child process. This can be used to prevent the thundering
  # herd problem on applications that do not gracefully reload.

  # process is started, and the process will only be started after all
  # dependent templates have been rendered at least once. The default value is
  # nil, which tells Consul Template to stop the child process and spawn a new
  # one instead of sending it a signal. This is useful for legacy applications
  # or applications that cannot properly reload their configuration without a
  # full reload.

  # This defines the signal sent to the child process when Consul Template is
  # gracefully shutting down. The application should begin a graceful cleanup.
